# Musical Ties
It can be difficult to find the perfect playlist for a given mood or occasion. Existing visualizations of music do not organize information in a way that allows the user to easily navigate the data and create their own playlists. Musical Ties is a platform that provides visualizations for musical playlists and songs. It guides the user through the process of exploring new music and understanding metrics that make up different playlists. With this platform, they are able to curate a new playlist that fits their desires.

The [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/) was used to get top Spotify playlists and metrics about the songs within the playlists. 

## Development Process 
One of the hardest thing about this project was creating our custom visualizations. Although many components started as references from existing D3 examples, they required a lot of modification to reach the level of cohesive design and interactivity that we were aimining for. 

We originally thought that our project would fit on a single page view, but decided to go toward multi-page view so that we can fit more information without things being cramped. We also iterated on the types of sorting and filtering functionality that would be available to the user and what would make the most sense for them to use. 

### Shared Work 
Together, Shariqah and Violetta spent a lot of time working on their design on Figma so that they could have a strong plan of what they wanted to implement. This helped them create a color scheme as well as to think through some of the more abstract parts of their design. 

In the next two sections we list components of the project we worked on.
